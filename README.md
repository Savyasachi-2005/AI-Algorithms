# ðŸ¤– AI Algorithms â€“ Lab Programs

This repository contains the **Artificial Intelligence lab programs** from my curriculum, focusing on classical **search algorithms**. These algorithms are part of the **explored content** in my academic coursework, designed to help understand and implement key AI techniques for problem-solving.

## ðŸ“š Lab Programs Overview

### 1. **Uninformed Search Algorithms**
These algorithms explore the search space without any domain-specific knowledge.

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Depth-Limited Search (DLS)**
- **Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)**
- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**
- **Recursive BFS**

### 2. **Informed (Heuristic) Search Algorithms**
These algorithms leverage heuristics to solve problems more efficiently.

- **Greedy Best-First Search**
- **A\* Search (A-star)**
- **Iterative Deepening A\***

Each of these algorithms has been implemented using **Python** and the **Jupyter Notebook** interface to clearly demonstrate the logic behind each search technique.

## ðŸ“– Curriculum Context

These programs are part of the **AI Laboratory** course in my curriculum. The goal is to provide hands-on experience with classical search algorithms in AI. The exercises are intended to help students:
- Understand the foundational concepts of AI problem-solving.
- Implement basic AI techniques using Python.
- Learn about the trade-offs and applications of different search algorithms.
